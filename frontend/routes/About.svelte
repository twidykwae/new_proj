	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>
		This app is the first version of something I want to grow into a full campus platform.
		Right now, I’m starting simple with a custom Svelte router and a few core features,
		but my goal is to keep expanding the project over time.
	</p>

	<p>
		I want this to become a place where students can find lost items quickly, look for
		potential roommates, and even share prayer requests when they need support. As I add
		more features, my hope is that the platform becomes something useful for the whole
		school community—something that actually helps people day to day.

	<p>
		This is just the beginning, and I’m excited to keep improving it as I learn more and
		as new ideas come up.
